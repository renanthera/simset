## TODO

* redo all of the backend code to be run by the server
* produce more minimal files that are sent to the browser
- randomize x values before data is sent to browser
* provide web ui to execute sims
* rewrite talent tree parser
* come up with talent tree rendering plan
- reimplement something akin to seralios' talent tree renderer?
- just use the raidbots one?
* new theming
* send jobs to a separate server for running sims
* talent tree generation
* see how vega performs rendering additional points (30k? 60k? 120k?)
* if it struggles, provide a prefabricated binned bar chart for the primary chart to filter off of and use vega-plus + db to query just the filtered data
* binned bar chart may be a more effective tool to convey combination density anyway

# fr combination generator
* u sets of f combinations
* v sets of r combinations

# multiple simc builds?
